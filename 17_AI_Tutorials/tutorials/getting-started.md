# Getting Started with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of machine learning, helping you understand fundamental concepts and implement your first ML model.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of basic mathematics (algebra, statistics)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic understanding of data structures

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

2. Create a new Python environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv ml-env
source ml-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ml-env\Scripts\activate
```

## Core Concepts

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

Key types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Data Preparation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Split features and target
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

### Building Your First Model

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Create and train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

## Common Challenges

1. Overfitting
   - Solution: Use cross-validation and regularization
   - Example: `from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score`

2. Underfitting
   - Solution: Add more features or use a more complex model
   - Example: Try different algorithms

3. Data Quality
   - Solution: Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Example: Handle missing values, outliers

## Best Practices

1. Data Preprocessing
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

2. Model Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

3. Hyperparameter Tuning
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],
    'max_iter': [100, 200, 300]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    LogisticRegression(),
    param_grid,
    cv=5
)

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f'Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}')
```

## Next Steps

1. Explore different algorithms:
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
