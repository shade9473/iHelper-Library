## Integration Opportunities

1. Resource Library Enhancement:
   - Content progression system
   - Achievement tracking
   - User engagement metrics
   - Learning path optimization

2. Security Integration:
   - Content protection
   - Access control
   - Version tracking
   - Backup automation

3. Analytics Implementation:
   - Usage tracking
   - Progress monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Engagement analysis

## Technical Notes
- All systems currently inactive
