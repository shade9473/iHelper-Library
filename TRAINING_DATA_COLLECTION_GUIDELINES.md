# Training Data Collection Guidelines

## Purpose
Establish ethical, privacy-preserving mechanisms for collecting user interaction data to enhance the Comprehensive Resource Library's navigation and recommendation systems.

## Ethical Principles
1. **User Privacy**
   - Anonymize all personally identifiable information
   - Use salted hashing for user identification
   - Provide transparent opt-in/opt-out mechanisms

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Collect only essential interaction metadata
   - Limit data collection to professional resource navigation
   - Avoid collecting sensitive personal information

3. **Consent and Transparency**
   - Clearly communicate data collection purposes
   - Obtain explicit user consent before data collection
   - Provide easy mechanism to review and delete personal data

## Data Collection Scope
### Tracked Interaction Types
- Resource navigation
- Recommendation interactions
- Professional pathway exploration
- Learning resource engagement

### Collected Metadata
- Anonymized user identifier
- Timestamp of interaction
- Current directory context
- Target directory
- Professional stage
- Interaction duration
- Interaction relevance score

## Privacy Protection Mechanisms
1. **User Anonymization**
   - Generate cryptographic hash of user identifier
   - Use consistent salt for hash generation
   - Prevent reverse-engineering of original identifier

2. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt stored interaction data
   - Use secure SQLite database with access controls
   - Implement secure data export mechanisms

3. **Consent Management**
   - Track user consent version
   - Allow granular consent preferences
   - Provide mechanism to withdraw consent

## Data Usage Guidelines
1. **Machine Learning Training**
   - Use collected data to improve recommendation algorithms
   - Focus on professional resource discovery optimization
   - Maintain strict separation between raw data and processed insights

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Analyze aggregate interaction patterns
   - Identify professional growth trajectory insights
   - Enhance navigation system based on collective user behavior

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regularly update data collection mechanisms
   - Adapt to emerging privacy standards
   - Maintain transparency in data usage

## User Rights
- Right to access collected data
- Right to request data deletion
- Right to understand data usage
- Right to opt-out of data collection

## Compliance
- Adhere to local and national data protection regulations
- Follow Port Townsend's ethical data usage standards
- Maintain highest level of professional data ethics
