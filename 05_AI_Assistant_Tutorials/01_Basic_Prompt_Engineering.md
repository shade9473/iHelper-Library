## Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models to achieve desired outcomes. Good prompts lead to better, more consistent results.

### Why Prompt Engineering Matters
- Improves response accuracy
- Reduces unnecessary iterations
- Saves time and resources
- Ensures consistent outputs

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Make it better"
✅ Good: "Improve the email response by making it more professional and addressing the customer's pricing concerns"
```

### 2. Specificity
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Write some code"
✅ Good: "Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of even numbers"
```

### 3. Context
```markdown
❌ Bad: "What's the next step?"
✅ Good: "Given that we've completed the database setup and user authentication, what's the next step in implementing the payment system?"
```

### 4. Structure
```markdown
✅ Format your prompt with:
1. Context/Background
2. Specific Task/Question
3. Desired Output Format
4. Constraints/Requirements
```

## Prompt Patterns

### 1. Role-Based Prompts
```markdown
"Act as a [ROLE] and [ACTION]"

Example:
"Act as a senior software architect and review this system design for scalability issues"
```

### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions
```markdown
"Follow these steps:
1. [First Step]
2. [Second Step]
3. [Third Step]
4. Provide the result"

Example:
"1. Analyze the given code snippet
2. Identify potential security vulnerabilities
3. Suggest specific improvements
4. Provide example code fixes"
```

### 3. Template-Based Prompts
```markdown
"Template:
- Context: [CONTEXT]
- Task: [TASK]
- Requirements: [REQUIREMENTS]
- Format: [FORMAT]"

Example:
- Context: E-commerce product API
- Task: Write error handling middleware
- Requirements: Handle common HTTP errors
- Format: Express.js middleware function
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Ambiguity
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Make it work"
✅ Good: "Debug the login function to handle invalid credentials correctly"
```

### 2. Lack of Context
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Update the code"
✅ Good: "Update the user authentication code to include password hashing using bcrypt"
```

### 3. Overly Complex Prompts
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Create a full system with authentication, database, API, and frontend"
✅ Good: "Create a basic user authentication API endpoint using Express.js and JWT"
```

## Examples and Templates

### 1. Code Review Prompt
```markdown
"Review the following code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Best practices
4. Code organization

Provide specific recommendations for each category."
```

### 2. Documentation Generation
```markdown
"Generate documentation for the following [LANGUAGE] function:
- Include: purpose, parameters, return value
- Add: example usage
- Note: edge cases
- Format: JSDoc/docstring style"
```

### 3. Bug Fix Request
```markdown
"Debug this code:
1. Current behavior: [DESCRIPTION]
2. Expected behavior: [DESCRIPTION]
3. Error message (if any): [ERROR]
4. Environment: [DETAILS]

Provide step-by-step debugging approach."
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought Prompting
```markdown
"Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, analyze the current implementation
2. Then, identify potential improvements
3. Finally, suggest specific changes

Think through each step and explain your reasoning."
```

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
```markdown
"Here are examples of good code comments:

Example 1:
// Calculate total price including tax and shipping
function calculateTotal(price, taxRate, shipping) {

Example 2:
// Validate user input before processing
function validateUserInput(input) {

Now, write comments for the following function..."
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
```markdown
Initial Prompt:
"Write a function to process user data"

Refined Prompt:
"Write a TypeScript function that:
1. Accepts user profile data (name, email, age)
2. Validates email format and age range (18-120)
3. Returns processed data or validation errors
4. Includes error handling and logging"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Refine
```markdown
1. Begin with basic prompt
2. Analyze response
3. Identify missing elements
4. Add specific requirements
5. Iterate until satisfied
```

### 2. Use Clear Formatting
```markdown
• Use bullet points
• Include numbered steps
• Add examples
• Specify input/output formats
```

### 3. Include Constraints
```markdown
"Generate a solution that:
- Uses only standard library functions
- Runs in O(n) time complexity
- Handles edge cases (null, empty input)
- Is memory efficient"
```

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Code Generation
```markdown
"Write a function that:
Input: Array of numbers
Output: Sum of even numbers
Requirements:
- Use Python
- Include input validation
- Add error handling
- Write unit tests"
```

### Exercise 2: Code Review
```markdown
"Review this code for:
1. Security issues
2. Performance bottlenecks
3. Code style
4. Documentation

Provide specific examples and fixes."
```

### Exercise 3: Documentation
```markdown
"Create API documentation for:
Endpoint: /api/users
Method: POST
Include:
- Request/response format
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes
- Example usage"
```
